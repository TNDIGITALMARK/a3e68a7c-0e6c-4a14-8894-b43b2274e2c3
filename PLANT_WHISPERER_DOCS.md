## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Pixel-Perfect Replication
- Colors extracted from design reference with exact HSL values
- Typography matches design (Lora serif + Inter sans-serif)
- Spacing and layout structure mirrors reference design
- Visual effects (shadows, gradients) precisely matched

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind responsive classes
- Grid layouts adapt from 1 to 3 columns based on screen size
- Navigation collapses appropriately on mobile
- Touch-friendly target sizes for mobile users

### Animations & Interactions
- **Breathing Animation**: Plant cards gently scale (1 → 1.02 → 1)
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift with enhanced shadows
- **Button Transitions**: Smooth color and scale changes
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Smooth transitions between colors
- **Typing Indicator**: Bouncing dots with staggered animation delays

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Technologies
- **Next.js 15.5.2**: App Router with React 19
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Next Image**: Optimized image loading

### Key Patterns
- **Client Components**: All interactive pages use 'use client'
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with shared types
- **Component Reusability**: Modular components (PlantCard, ChatInterface, etc.)
- **Mock Data**: Realistic sample data for demonstration
- **CSS Variables**: Design tokens for consistency

### Performance
- **Image Optimization**: Next/Image for automatic optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load progressively
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transforms for 60fps animations
- **Efficient Re-renders**: React hooks optimized for performance

## 🌱 Future Enhancement Opportunities
